# ameliorate
The main objective is to restore seasoned images taken from the past like world wars or dilapidated images and giving them life using deep learning methods. This restoration includes colourisation of black and white images, denoising the image, enhancing low resolution images to super resolution images, adjusting the focus of the image, artifact removal and correction.
